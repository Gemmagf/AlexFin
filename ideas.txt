**Säule 3a: Save on Taxes & Secure Your Future**  
The Swiss 3rd pillar (Säule 3a) is more than just a savings account—it's a smart retirement tool that lets you deduct contributions from your taxes each year. You can invest via a bank (often with ETFs for higher growth) or through an insurance provider (typically less flexible but includes life coverage). Not sure what’s best? I help clients find the right fit.
